AI has changed the cybersecurity landscape. Attackers use generative AI to produce a greater quantity of increasingly sophisticated attacks. Abnormal is uniquely well positioned to detect and remediate those sophisticated attacks.

Abnormalâ€™s detection engine is built natively with AI models that ingest, analyze, and cross-correlate internal data sets to detect and remediate novel malicious attacks, including AI-generated attacks. View the product tour to see how Abnormal is uniquely positioned to detect and remediate these attacks.

The Risks of Generative AI
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, the DALL-E2 image generator, and more are leveraged by malicious actors to create convincing phishing emails, transforming an average threat actor into a good one.

In fact, in a recent survey conducted by Abnormal, 80% of security leaders believe their organization has already started receiving AI-generated email attacks.
