How do organizations prevent this rapid spread of malicious AI? With good AI.
This message shows an email attack that may have been created using generative AI.

Determining if the attack was AI-generated is challenging. The language and phrasing used by AI programs are becoming more natural, making it harder to detect them using traditional methods.

View Analysis Overview
Abnormal Security delivers an AI-native approach to email security, building a baseline of the known-good behavior of every employee and vendor in an organization.

Here, we can see that it identified an abnormal recipient pattern and suspicious sending behavior from an unusual sender.
View the Text Analysis
Our natural language processing models identified language in the email body that indicated an attacker was attempting to fraudulently obtain information and money from your organization.AI has changed the cybersecurity landscape. Attackers use generative AI to produce a greater quantity of increasingly sophisticated attacks. Abnormal is uniquely well positioned to detect and remediate those sophisticated attacks.

Abnormal’s detection engine is built natively with AI models that ingest, analyze, and cross-correlate internal data sets to detect and remediate novel malicious attacks, including AI-generated attacks. View the product tour to see how Abnormal is uniquely positioned to detect and remediate these attacks.

The Risks of Generative AI
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, the DALL-E2 image generator, and more are leveraged by malicious actors to create convincing phishing emails, transforming an average threat actor into a good one.

In fact, in a recent survey conducted by Abnormal, 80% of security leaders believe their organization has already started receiving AI-generated email attacks.

The Threat Log contains everything you'll want to know about the email threats targeting your organization. Clicking each email will take you to the details page, where you can explore each attack in more depth.

So how is Abnormal able to detect and stop this type of attack.What is Suspicious About this Email?
To an unaware recipient, this email seems legitimate. It appears to come from Jonathan Green, a VIP within the organization, and has been sent to another internal employee. So why was it blocked?Discover Account Takeover
You can see which users within the organization may be compromised. Abnormal uses unusual login methods, locations, communication patterns, and user privilege changes to detected potentially compromised accounts and then automatically remediate them.Abnormal takes a fundamentally different approach to email security to help you protect more, spend less, and secure the future. Continue this interactive demo to see how Abnormal:

Stops more attacks using behavioral AI, learning the behavior of every identity to detect anomalous activity.
Reduces total costs by fully automating email security and enabling customers to remove the secure email gateway.
Protects your business today and tomorrow with a modern architecture that detects emerging threats and multi-channel attacks.Ensure Trust Across the Supply Chain
Your employees trust the communications they receive from your vendors. Threat actors know this and will use a variety of techniques, such as vendor impersonation or use of a compromised email account, to trick your employees into sharing confidential information or transferring funds.

View the Email Details
To an unaware recipient, this email seems legitimate. It has been sent from a trusted vendor and it includes a previous email thread between Renee West and Lucia Foreman.

View the Sender Identity Analysis
Our understanding of individual behaviors extends beyond internal employees and understands known behavior for every person sending messages to your organization—including your vendors.

This enables Abnormal to detect deviations from previously observed patterns and determine when an email may be sent from an externally-compromised account.VendorBase shows a list of all the external organizations communicating with your employees.Discover the Vendor Profile
Inside the vendor profile, you can see basic vendor information, engagement, and activity across your entire email environment.

The platform shows the risk level for vendors, based on activity across all Abnormal customers. This ensures that you are protected from risky vendors, even if they have yet to target your organization.VendorBase is a globally federated database that tracks which vendors are communicating with your organization and shows their corresponding risk level.

Compromised and impersonated vendor accounts are a common entry point for costly cyberattacks. Employees are more likely to click a dangerous link, pay an invoice, or send sensitive information when the request comes from a trusted entity.

Abnormal can detect subtle signals of a compromised vendor, analyzing email content to flag suspicious behavior like urgent tones and financial requests.
