# ABX model explained & comparsions with other SEGs

## Content 1
Abnormal Security's innovative ABX model employs behavioral AI across various platforms, enhancing the security infrastructure of organizations using services like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, and Zoom by protecting against an expansive spectrum of attack types that traditional SEGs might miss. Let's explore further how this technology compensates for the limitations of SEGs and delve into three specific examples of threats that can be efficiently prevented by Abnormal's technology:

1. **Vendor Email Compromise (VEC):** Abnormal's ABX model offers dedicated protection against VEC, a sophisticated scam where attackers impersonate vendors or use compromised email accounts to manipulate employees into divulging confidential information or conducting unauthorized fund transfers. By analyzing behavioral patterns and communication anomalies, the ABX model is better equipped than traditional SEGs to detect such schemes, which rely on exploiting trust rather than identifiable malware signatures.

2. **Generative AI Attacks:** With the emergence of AI-powered tools, attackers can craft more sophisticated phishing campaigns that might evade traditional security measures. Abnormal Security's ABX model is tailored to counter generative AI attacks, which use these advanced tools to create convincing spear-phishing emails or social engineering lures. Traditional SEGs, based on static databases of known threats, may not be quick to adapt to this inventive attack vector. In sharp contrast, the ABX model can analyze the subtle cues and deviations from known patterns to block these AI-generated threats.

3. **Lateral Phishing:** This form of attack occurs when a threat actor gains access to an internal account and then uses that compromised position to launch additional phishing attempts within an organization. The traditional SEG might not catch such attacks because they originate from within the trusted network. However, the ABX model, focusing on behavioral anomalies, can identify unusual activities associated with these internal accounts, thereby preventing the attack from spreading and causing further damage.

In synthesizing the diverse offerings and the wide array of threats it can mitigate, Abnormal Security's ABX model stands out for its adaptive, proactive, and behavior-focused analysis. It not only understands user-to-user interactions but also recognizes deviations across a broad array of platforms and communication channels, flagging even the most strategically crafted attacks. By doing so, the ABX model keeps one step ahead of attackers, ensuring robust protection in an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape.

The subject of Business Email Compromise (BEC) is indeed critical for companies of all sizes, as email continues to be a primary means of communication in business, making it a prime target for cyberattacks. Let's begin our comparison of the ABX model and traditional Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) by first acknowledging how each operates.

**Traditional SEGs:**

Secure Email Gateways are designed to protect an organization's email from a variety of threats by using rule-based filters and signature detection methods. These tools often rely on static lists of known threats, regularly updated to include new types of malware and phishing attempts. SEGs analyze incoming emails for spam, known phishing attempts, and malicious attachments.

**Advantages:**

- They are effective against known threats for which they have signatures or defined anti-spam rules.
- They can be customized to filter out emails from untrusted or suspicious sources.
- SEGs generally provide good performance against mass spam and traditional malware campaigns.

**Disadvantages:**

- They may not detect advanced attacks that do not match any known signatures or that obfuscate malicious intent in sophisticated ways.
- They struggle with the detection of social engineering attacks that do not involve malware, like BEC or VEC.
- Adapting to new and evolving threats can take time, leaving a window of vulnerability.
ABX Model:

The Abnormal Behavior Technology (ABX) model by Abnormal Security represents a step beyond the traditional SEGs by using behavioral AI to improve the detection and prevention of sophisticated email attacks which may bypass conventional SEG protection.

**Advantages:**

- Superior at detecting sophisticated scams like Vendor Email Compromise (VEC) by analyzing communication patterns and behavioral anomalies rather than relying solely on known signatures.
- More effective against emergent threats using generative AI due to its proactive, pattern-based detection capabilities.
- Capable of detecting lateral phishing by monitoring for unusual activities from internal accounts that traditional SEGs might trust implicitly.

**Disadvantages:**

As a more complex system, there may be a steeper learning curve for administrators to effectively manage and understand the system's insights.
Depending on its implementation, the behavioral models might require a period of learning to establish a baseline of normal behavior, which might initially result in false positives or negatives.
Greater complexity might mean higher cost, both in terms of acquisition and operational expenses.
In summary, while traditional SEGs offer a robust baseline of defense against well-understood threats, the ABX model's use of behavioral AI provides a more adaptive and forward-looking approach to threat detection and prevention. This is especially important given the evolving sophistication of BEC attacks that might not utilize typical malware signatures that SEGs are adept at identifying.

The three threats you've provided—VEC, generative AI attacks, and lateral phishing—are indeed very pertinent to today's business security concerns. Abnormal's ABX model's approaches, such as behavior analysis and anomaly detection, offer a clear advantage in identifying and blocking these types of attacks compared to traditional SEGs. As attacks become more sophisticated and rely less on known malware and more on social engineering or subtle manipulations, solutions like ABX may become increasingly essential.
