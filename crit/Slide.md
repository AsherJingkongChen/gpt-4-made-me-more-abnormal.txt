<!-- **Slide 2: Introduction**
- Outline:
  + Briefly introduce the topic and its significance.
  + Emphasize the need for robust email security in today's cyber threat landscape.
  + Reference the critical role of email communication in business and the rising sophistication of cyberattacks. -->

**Slide 3: Overview of ABX Model**
- Outline:
  + Explain that the ABX model, developed by Abnormal Security, employs behavioral AI to enhance security infrastructure.
  + Mention the platforms it supports (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom).
  + Highlight how ABX protects against a wide range of attacks that traditional SEGs might miss.
  + Integrate insights from Content 1 about ABX's adaptive, proactive, and behavior-focused analysis.

**Slide 4: Limitations of Traditional SEGs**
- Outline:
  + Discuss the limitations of traditional Secure Email Gateways (SEGs).
  + Mention that SEGs rely on rule-based filters and signature detection methods.
  + Explain that they may struggle with advanced attacks, social engineering, and emerging threats.
  + Incorporate insights from Content 2 about the disadvantages of traditional SEGs.

**Slide 5: ABX Model Advantages**
- Outline:
  + Highlight the advantages of the ABX model over traditional SEGs.
  + Emphasize that ABX uses behavioral AI to analyze communication patterns and detect sophisticated scams like Vendor Email Compromise (VEC).
  + Mention its effectiveness against generative AI attacks and lateral phishing attempts.
  + Reiterate the points made in Content 1 about ABX's superior detection capabilities.

**Slide 6: Comparison: Traditional SEGs vs. ABX Model**
- Outline:
  + Provide a side-by-side comparison of traditional SEGs and the ABX model.
  + Highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
  + Utilize insights from Content 2 to reinforce the comparison points.

**Slide 7: Example 1: Vendor Email Compromise (VEC)**
- Outline:
  + Explain VEC and how attackers manipulate employees to divulge confidential information or conduct unauthorized fund transfers.
  + Describe how the ABX model's behavioral analysis is better equipped to detect VEC compared to traditional SEGs.
  + Reference specific points from Content 1 regarding ABX's protection against VEC.

**Slide 8: Example 2: Generative AI Attacks**
- Outline:
  + Discuss how attackers use AI-powered tools to create sophisticated phishing campaigns.
  + Explain that ABX's proactive, pattern-based detection capabilities can counter generative AI attacks effectively.
  + Integrate insights from Content 1 on ABX's capabilities against generative AI attacks.

**Slide 9: Example 3: Lateral Phishing**
- Outline:
  + Define lateral phishing and how threat actors use compromised internal accounts to launch additional phishing attempts.
  + Highlight how the ABX model's focus on behavioral anomalies can identify and prevent lateral phishing attacks.
  + Reference specific information from Content 1 about ABX's ability to detect lateral phishing.

**Slide 10: Conclusion**
- Outline:
  + Summarize the key points discussed throughout the presentation.
  + Emphasize that the ABX model offers adaptive, behavior-focused analysis for robust protection against evolving cyber threats.
  + Tie back to the introductory statement on the significance of robust email security.
