**Slide 2: Limitations of Traditional SEGs**
- Outline:
  + Discuss the limitations of traditional Secure Email Gateways (SEGs).
  + Mention that SEGs rely on rule-based filters and signature detection methods.
  + Explain that they may struggle with advanced attacks, social engineering, and emerging threats.
  + Incorporate insights from Content 2 about the disadvantages of traditional SEGs.
- Content:
  + Traditional Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) are designed to protect an organization's email from a variety of threats using rule-based filters and signature detection methods. SEGs primarily rely on static lists of known threats, which may not be effective against sophisticated attacks that do not match any known signatures or obfuscate malicious intent. *[s-2-1]*
  + However, SEGs have certain limitations that can leave organizations vulnerable to advanced attacks and emerging threats. SEGs may struggle with the detection of social engineering attacks, such as Business Email Compromise (BEC) or Vendor Email Compromise (VEC), which do not involve malware but instead manipulate human behavior. *[s-2-2]*
  + Adapting to new and evolving threats can be a challenge for SEGs, as it may take time to update their databases and detection mechanisms, leaving a window of vulnerability. *[s-2-1]*

**Slide 3: ABX Model Advantages**
- Outline:
  + Highlight the advantages of the ABX model over traditional SEGs.
  + Emphasize that ABX uses behavioral AI to analyze communication patterns and detect sophisticated scams like Vendor Email Compromise (VEC).
  + Mention its effectiveness against generative AI attacks and lateral phishing attempts.
  + Reiterate the points made in Content 1 about ABX's superior detection capabilities.
- Content:
  + The ABX model offers several advantages over traditional SEGs, making it a more advanced and effective security solution.
  + ABX utilizes behavioral AI to analyze communication patterns and identify anomalies, allowing it to detect and prevent sophisticated scams like Vendor Email Compromise (VEC). *[s-3-1]*
  + Unlike traditional SEGs that rely on static lists of known threats, ABX's adaptive analysis enables it to detect emerging threats and adapt to new attack methods in real-time. *[s-3-3]*
  + ABX's proactive approach and pattern-based detection capabilities make it highly effective against generative AI attacks, which leverage AI-powered tools to create convincing spear-phishing emails or social engineering lures. *[s-3-2]* *[s-3-4]* *[s-3-5]* *[s-3-6]*
  + Additionally, ABX's behavior-focused analysis enables it to detect and prevent lateral phishing attempts, where threat actors use compromised internal accounts to launch phishing attacks within an organization. *[s-3-2]*

**Slide 4: Comparison: Traditional SEGs vs. ABX Model**
- Outline:
  + Provide a side-by-side comparison of traditional SEGs and the ABX model.
  + Highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
  + Utilize insights from Content 2 to reinforce the comparison points.
- Content:
  + Traditional SEGs rely on rule-based filters and signature detection methods, while the ABX model utilizes behavioral AI for enhanced threat detection and prevention.
  + Traditional SEGs are effective againstknown threats but may struggle with advanced attacks, social engineering, and emerging threats. In contrast, the ABX model excels in detecting sophisticated scams, generative AI attacks, and lateral phishing attempts.
  + Traditional SEGs often require manual updates and may have delayed response times to new threats, whereas the ABX model's adaptive analysis enables real-time detection and proactive protection against evolving threats.
  + Traditional SEGs primarily focus on email-based threats, while the ABX model extends its protection to other communication platforms such as Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, and Zoom.
  + Traditional SEGs may generate false positives or false negatives due to the limitations of rule-based filters, while the ABX model's behavior-focused analysis minimizes false positives and enhances threat detection accuracy.
  + Overall, the ABX model offers a more robust and comprehensive security solution compared to traditional SEGs, addressing the shortcomings of rule-based filtering and signature detection methods. *[s-4-2]*
