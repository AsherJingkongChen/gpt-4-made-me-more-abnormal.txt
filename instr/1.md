Question:
Does the Abnormal platform work with both Microsoft and Google cloud email platforms?
Answer:
Yes, Abnormal can integrate via API with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace.

Sub-Question 1:
Is the Abnormal platform a secure email gateway?
Immediate Answer 1:
No. Like a secure email gateway (SEG), Abnormal is designed to stop email attacks, but the two solutions tackle this problem in different ways. SEGs rely on known indicators of compromise in order to identify a malicious email. In contrast, Abnormal baselines known, healthy behavior inside of your environment and then looks for anomalies. This allows Abnormal to better detect changing attacks that do not carry known indicators of compromise and expand coverage into connected applications.

Sub-Question 2:
Can Abnormal replace my SEG?
Immediate Answer 2:
Yes. When used with Microsoft 365, Abnormal is able to replace SEG functionality, while giving you superior detection efficacy. If you’re interested in learning more about how Abnormal might replace your gateway, please contact us.

Sub-Question 3:
What data does the Abnormal platform store?
Immediate Answer 3:
Abnormal is designed to store the least amount of data required. We do not use journaling or transport rules to store copies of your emails, unlike many of our competitors. You can learn more about our data handling on our Trust Center. 

Sub-Question 4:
Can the Abnormal platform scale to meet enterprise needs?
Immediate Answer 4:
Yes, Abnormal’s API architecture delivers a highly scalable system that will process, score, and remediate email attacks. Abnormal processes messages quickly without the added risk of affecting message delivery that is typical of inline solutions. Our platform is proven to scale to the largest enterprise environments. The largest organization we work with today has over 600,000 mailboxes.

For Your Information (FYI,):
Abnormal's API-based approach to integration gives access to thousands of contextual signals invisible to other solutions. This enables Abnormal to correlate user identity, behavior indicators, and email content to detect the full spectrum of attacks.

The Abnormal platform integrates with cloud email platforms, popular cloud collaboration applications, Okta, and CrowdStrike via API in seconds. This allows it to ingest thousands of signals that help identify suspicious activities across users and tenants.

Learn how Abnormal’s cloud-native API integration eliminates all the difficulties of deploying email security. It takes minutes to set up, and requires no effort to uncover attacks.

As the economy shifts and budgets tighten, it’s more important than ever to showcase the value of the security tools you use to protect your organization.

According to the Forrester TEI Study, Abnormal Security can yield a 278% ROI within three years and help your organization avoid $4 million in losses from business email compromise. On top of that, Abnormal can save your SOC team 5,000 hours every year by automating email triage and investigation.

Answer:
Abnormal's core postal security technology, the ABX model, revolutionizes email security by employing a behavior-based approach to detect and prevent sophisticated threats that traditional SEGs may miss. Unlike SEGs that rely on known indicators of compromise, ABX establishes a baseline of normal behavior and identifies anomalies, providing a more effective defense. Three examples of threats mitigated by ABX include:

Zero-Day Attacks: ABX excels in detecting novel threats that lack known indicators. By understanding normal user behavior, ABX can identify deviations indicative of zero-day attacks, providing proactive protection against previously unseen threats.

Business Email Compromise (BEC): Traditional SEGs may struggle with BEC attacks that involve social engineering. ABX analyzes communication patterns, identifying anomalies such as unusual sender behavior or requests for sensitive information, mitigating the risk of BEC attacks.

Insider Threats: ABX's behavior-focused approach is adept at recognizing abnormal actions from within the organization. Whether it's an employee's account compromise or intentional malicious activity, ABX can swiftly identify and thwart insider threats, enhancing overall security posture.

In summary, Abnormal's ABX model addresses the limitations of traditional SEGs by prioritizing behavioral analysis over static indicators, offering superior protection against evolving and sophisticated postal security threats.
