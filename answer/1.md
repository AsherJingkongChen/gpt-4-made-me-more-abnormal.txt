Original Question: Introduce Abnormal's core postal security technology (such as ABX model), and explain how this technology can make up for the shortcomings of traditional SEG. Please give three examples of postal security threats or attacks that can be prevented by the above technologies.

Answer: Abnormal's core postal security technology, the ABX model, revolutionizes email security by employing a behavior-based approach to detect and prevent sophisticated threats that traditional SEGs may miss. Unlike SEGs that rely on known indicators of compromise, ABX establishes a baseline of normal behavior and identifies anomalies, providing a more effective defense. Three examples of threats mitigated by ABX include:

Zero-Day Attacks: ABX excels in detecting novel threats that lack known indicators. By understanding normal user behavior, ABX can identify deviations indicative of zero-day attacks, providing proactive protection against previously unseen threats.

Business Email Compromise (BEC): Traditional SEGs may struggle with BEC attacks that involve social engineering. ABX analyzes communication patterns, identifying anomalies such as unusual sender behavior or requests for sensitive information, mitigating the risk of BEC attacks.

Insider Threats: ABX's behavior-focused approach is adept at recognizing abnormal actions from within the organization. Whether it's an employee's account compromise or intentional malicious activity, ABX can swiftly identify and thwart insider threats, enhancing overall security posture.

In summary, Abnormal's ABX model addresses the limitations of traditional SEGs by prioritizing behavioral analysis over static indicators, offering superior protection against evolving and sophisticated postal security threats.

I understand that you are on a deadline and require information on Abnormal Security's postal security technology, specifically their ABX model, and how it contrasts with traditional Security Email Gateways (SEGs). Additionally, you are interested in examples of email security threats that can be addressed by this technology. I will provide this information step by step.

Step 1: Understanding the ABX Model Abnormal Security's core postal security technology, the Abnormal Behavior Technology (ABX), takes a unique approach to email security. Instead of relying on traditional methods, such as signature-based detection or static rules, the ABX model uses advanced machine learning techniques to establish a dynamic profile of normal user behavior. This profile is then used to detect anomalies that could indicate a security threat.

Step 2: How ABX Makes Up for Shortcomings of Traditional SEGs SEGs have historically been the first line of defense against email threats. They operate on known threats and use predefined rules to filter out spam and malicious emails. However, SEGs are less effective against sophisticated attacks that do not match predefined threat patterns. In contrast, the ABX model mitigates this by:

Analyzing a wide range of data points, including communication patterns and employee relationships, to detect subtle signs of abnormal behavior.
Continuously learning and adapting to the evolving email environment, ensuring that the defense against threats remains current and robust.
Providing context-rich insights that allow security teams to understand and respond to alerts more effectively.
Step 3: Examples of Preventable Postal Security Threats Here are three examples of postal security threats that the ABX model can prevent which traditional SEGs might not catch:

Spear Phishing: Unlike mass phishing campaigns, spear phishing targets specific individuals with personalized content. The ABX model can detect anomalies in email communications that might indicate a spear phishing attempt, such as small changes to sender addresses or unusual language, even if the email doesn't contain known malicious links or attachments.

Account Takeover (ATO) Attacks: In an ATO attack, an attacker gains unauthorized access to a legitimate user's email account. The ABX technology can notice unusual activity like logins from new locations or devices, massive deletions, or forwarding rule changes.

Supply Chain Compromise: This involves attackers infiltrating a trusted vendor's systems to send malware-laden emails to their customers. Since these emails come from a legitimate source, traditional SEGs might overlook them. However, the ABX model can spot inconsistencies in email patterns or content that deviate from the usual communication from that vendor, potentially stopping a supply chain attack.

To give you an accurate and detailed analysis of the ABX model's techniques, I will need to review the files you have provided. Please bear with me as I carefully read through the material to extract pertinent information.

Certainly, let's address the Business Email Compromise (BEC) solution offered by Abnormal Security.

BEC attacks are a form of email-based fraud that often involve social engineering tactics where attackers pose as trusted figures, such as executives or suppliers, to trick employees into transferring money or sensitive information. Traditional defenses can miss these attacks because they don't necessarily contain malicious payloads that can be detected by signature-based filtering systems.

Abnormal Security approaches BEC defense by using their Abnormal Behavior Technology (ABX) model, which is designed to identify and block these sophisticated scams. Here's how Abnormal Security's BEC solution works:

Behavioral Profiling: The ABX model creates a comprehensive behavioral profile for every individual within an organization. This encompasses writing style, typical communication patterns, and historical data on email transactions.

Contextual Analysis: The system analyzes a wide array of signals in real-time, such as the context of emails, the nature of requests within the messages, and the timing of the communications. This includes scrutinizing the header information of emails for signs of spoofing and examining email content for suspicious requests.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Using these profiles and contextual clues, the machine learning algorithms can detect anomalies that may indicate a BEC attempt. Anomalies could range from deviations in writing style, unusual transaction requests, or email communications that do not follow the normal pattern established for a user or the organization as a whole.

Response Actions: Once an anomaly is detected that could signify a BEC attack, the system can take appropriate actions, such as alerting the user or the security team, quarantining the suspicious email, or blocking the sender. Additionally, it can provide detailed insights and analysis for the security personnel to review.

By employing advanced analytics, natural language processing, and behavioral analysis, Abnormal Security's BEC solution aims to stop these fraud attempts before they result in financial loss or data breach.
