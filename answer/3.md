Sure! Based on the content you provided, I have created a presentation on the topic "ABX Model Explained & Comparisons with Other SEGs." Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the presentation:

Slide 1: Title Slide
- Title: ABX Model Explained & Comparisons with Other SEGs

Slide 2: Introduction
- Briefly introduce the topic and its significance.
- Emphasize the need for robust email security in today's cyber threat landscape.

Slide 3: Overview of ABX Model
- Explain that the ABX model, developed by Abnormal Security, employs behavioral AI to enhance security infrastructure.
- Mention the platforms it supports (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom).
- Highlight how ABX protects against a wide range of attacks that traditional SEGs might miss.

Slide 4: Limitations of Traditional SEGs
- Discuss the limitations of traditional Secure Email Gateways (SEGs).
- Mention that SEGs rely on rule-based filters and signature detection methods.
- Explain that they may struggle with advanced attacks, social engineering, and emerging threats.

Slide 5: ABX Model Advantages
- Highlight the advantages of the ABX model over traditional SEGs.
- Emphasize that ABX uses behavioral AI to analyze communication patterns and detect sophisticated scams like Vendor Email Compromise (VEC).
- Mention its effectiveness against generative AI attacks and lateral phishing attempts.

Slide 6: Comparison: Traditional SEGs vs. ABX Model
- Provide a side-by-side comparison of traditional SEGs and the ABX model.
- Highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Slide 7: Example 1: Vendor Email Compromise (VEC)
- Explain VEC and how attackers manipulate employees to divulge confidential information or conduct unauthorized fund transfers.
- Describe how the ABX model's behavioral analysis is better equipped to detect VEC compared to traditional SEGs.

Slide 8: Example 2: Generative AI Attacks
- Discuss how attackers use AI-powered tools to create sophisticated phishing campaigns.
- Explain that ABX's proactive, pattern-based detection capabilities can counter generative AI attacks effectively.

Slide 9: Example 3: Lateral Phishing
- Define lateral phishing and how threat actors use compromised internal accounts to launch additional phishing attempts.
- Highlight how the ABX model's focus on behavioral anomalies can identify and prevent lateral phishing attacks.

Slide 10: Conclusion
- Summarize the key points discussed throughout the presentation.
- Emphasize that the ABX model offers adaptive, behavior-focused analysis for robust protection against evolving cyber threats.

Slide 11: Q&A and Contact Information
- Encourage the audience to ask questions.
- Provide contact information for further inquiries or discussions.

Note: This is a general outline for the presentation. You can further customize it by adding visuals, graphics, and additional content as per your requirements and the presentation tool you are using.
