Original Question: Introduce Abnormal's core postal security technology (such as ABX model), and explain how this technology can make up for the shortcomings of traditional SEG. Please give three examples of postal security threats or attacks that can be prevented by the above technologies.

Answer: Abnormal's core postal security technology, the ABX model, revolutionizes email security by employing a behavior-based approach to detect and prevent sophisticated threats that traditional SEGs may miss. Unlike SEGs that rely on known indicators of compromise, ABX establishes a baseline of normal behavior and identifies anomalies, providing a more effective defense. Three examples of threats mitigated by ABX include:

Zero-Day Attacks: ABX excels in detecting novel threats that lack known indicators. By understanding normal user behavior, ABX can identify deviations indicative of zero-day attacks, providing proactive protection against previously unseen threats.

Business Email Compromise (BEC): Traditional SEGs may struggle with BEC attacks that involve social engineering. ABX analyzes communication patterns, identifying anomalies such as unusual sender behavior or requests for sensitive information, mitigating the risk of BEC attacks.

Insider Threats: ABX's behavior-focused approach is adept at recognizing abnormal actions from within the organization. Whether it's an employee's account compromise or intentional malicious activity, ABX can swiftly identify and thwart insider threats, enhancing overall security posture.

In summary, Abnormal's ABX model addresses the limitations of traditional SEGs by prioritizing behavioral analysis over static indicators, offering superior protection against evolving and sophisticated postal security threats.

The provided answer offers a solid introduction to Abnormal Security's core technology, the ABX model, and affirms its innovative take on email security by employing a behavior-based approach to detect and prevent sophisticated email threats—something traditional Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) might miss. Let's expand a bit on how ABX makes up for the limitations of SEGs and provide three specific examples of threats that can be prevented using Abnormal's technology based on the information we have from their documents.

1. **Vendor Email Compromise (VEC):** The ABX model is specifically designed to protect against sophisticated scams such as vendor impersonation or the use of a compromised email account to deceive employees into sharing confidential information or transferring funds【34†source】. Unlike SEGs, which might rely on signature-based detection that attackers can evade, ABX would detect anomalies in communication behavior to prevent VEC attacks.
In this context, **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** can be seen as a broader category of threat encompassing VEC, which indicates that Abnormal's technology could likewise be effective against BEC by identifying unusual patterns that might signify an attempt at impersonation or fraud.

2. **Zero-Day Attacks:** While your summary adequately noted that ABX handles zero-day attacks by looking for deviations from normal behavior, Abnormal Security's documents further emphasize the system's ability to detect emerging threats based on behavior rather than relying solely on prior knowledge of attacks. This means that even if an attacker uses a completely new technique or malware variant that has not been previously cataloged, ABX's behavioral analysis can flag the abnormal activity.

3. **Multi-Channel Attacks:** Reflecting on the "modern architecture" referred to in Abnormal Security's documents, it can be inferred that ABX is made to deal with threats not just through email but across multiple communication channels. Given the rise of omnichannel attacks, where threat actors may exploit various platforms to launch a coordinated assault on a target, this aspect of ABX could prove to be a significant advantage over traditional SEGs.

In synthesizing this information, it becomes clear that the ABX model's strengths lie in its data-driven, behavior-centric analysis capabilities that expand the scope of threat detection beyond the limitations of conventional SEGs. The emphasis is on understanding legitimate user behaviors to flag deviations—whether from a trusted vendor's compromised account or a never-before-seen zero-day exploit. This approach ensures that even the most cunning and novel of attacks have a high chance of being detected and mitigated, providing a level of proactive security that evolves alongside emerging threats.

*Re P.P.*

Abnormal Security's innovative ABX model employs behavioral AI across various platforms, enhancing the security infrastructure of organizations using services like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, and Zoom by protecting against an expansive spectrum of attack types that traditional SEGs might miss. Let's explore further how this technology compensates for the limitations of SEGs and delve into three specific examples of threats that can be efficiently prevented by Abnormal's technology:

1. **Vendor Email Compromise (VEC):** Abnormal's ABX model offers dedicated protection against VEC, a sophisticated scam where attackers impersonate vendors or use compromised email accounts to manipulate employees into divulging confidential information or conducting unauthorized fund transfers. By analyzing behavioral patterns and communication anomalies, the ABX model is better equipped than traditional SEGs to detect such schemes, which rely on exploiting trust rather than identifiable malware signatures【45†source】.

2. **Generative AI Attacks:** With the emergence of AI-powered tools, attackers can craft more sophisticated phishing campaigns that might evade traditional security measures. Abnormal Security's ABX model is tailored to counter generative AI attacks, which use these advanced tools to create convincing spear-phishing emails or social engineering lures. Traditional SEGs, based on static databases of known threats, may not be quick to adapt to this inventive attack vector. In sharp contrast, the ABX model can analyze the subtle cues and deviations from known patterns to block these AI-generated threats.

3. **Lateral Phishing:** This form of attack occurs when a threat actor gains access to an internal account and then uses that compromised position to launch additional phishing attempts within an organization. The traditional SEG might not catch such attacks because they originate from within the trusted network. However, the ABX model, focusing on behavioral anomalies, can identify unusual activities associated with these internal accounts, thereby preventing the attack from spreading and causing further damage.

In synthesizing the diverse offerings and the wide array of threats it can mitigate, Abnormal Security's ABX model stands out for its adaptive, proactive, and behavior-focused analysis. It not only understands user-to-user interactions but also recognizes deviations across a broad array of platforms and communication channels, flagging even the most strategically crafted attacks. By doing so, the ABX model keeps one step ahead of attackers, ensuring robust protection in an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape.

*Comp. X*

The subject of Business Email Compromise (BEC) is indeed critical for companies of all sizes, as email continues to be a primary means of communication in business, making it a prime target for cyberattacks. Let's begin our comparison of the ABX model and traditional Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) by first acknowledging how each operates.

**Traditional SEGs:**

Secure Email Gateways are designed to protect an organization's email from a variety of threats by using rule-based filters and signature detection methods. These tools often rely on static lists of known threats, regularly updated to include new types of malware and phishing attempts. SEGs analyze incoming emails for spam, known phishing attempts, and malicious attachments.

**Advantages:**

- They are effective against known threats for which they have signatures or defined anti-spam rules.
- They can be customized to filter out emails from untrusted or suspicious sources.
- SEGs generally provide good performance against mass spam and traditional malware campaigns.

**Disadvantages:**

- They may not detect advanced attacks that do not match any known signatures or that obfuscate malicious intent in sophisticated ways.
- They struggle with the detection of social engineering attacks that do not involve malware, like BEC or VEC.
- Adapting to new and evolving threats can take time, leaving a window of vulnerability.
ABX Model:

The Abnormal Behavior Technology (ABX) model by Abnormal Security represents a step beyond the traditional SEGs by using behavioral AI to improve the detection and prevention of sophisticated email attacks which may bypass conventional SEG protection.

**Advantages:**

- Superior at detecting sophisticated scams like Vendor Email Compromise (VEC) by analyzing communication patterns and behavioral anomalies rather than relying solely on known signatures.
- More effective against emergent threats using generative AI due to its proactive, pattern-based detection capabilities.
- Capable of detecting lateral phishing by monitoring for unusual activities from internal accounts that traditional SEGs might trust implicitly.

**Disadvantages:**

As a more complex system, there may be a steeper learning curve for administrators to effectively manage and understand the system's insights.
Depending on its implementation, the behavioral models might require a period of learning to establish a baseline of normal behavior, which might initially result in false positives or negatives.
Greater complexity might mean higher cost, both in terms of acquisition and operational expenses.
In summary, while traditional SEGs offer a robust baseline of defense against well-understood threats, the ABX model's use of behavioral AI provides a more adaptive and forward-looking approach to threat detection and prevention. This is especially important given the evolving sophistication of BEC attacks that might not utilize typical malware signatures that SEGs are adept at identifying.

The three threats you've provided—VEC, generative AI attacks, and lateral phishing—are indeed very pertinent to today's business security concerns. Abnormal's ABX model's approaches, such as behavior analysis and anomaly detection, offer a clear advantage in identifying and blocking these types of attacks compared to traditional SEGs. As attacks become more sophisticated and rely less on known malware and more on social engineering or subtle manipulations, solutions like ABX may become increasingly essential.
